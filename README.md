This project focuses on analyzing financial market performance, risk, and liquidity using historical market data.
The analysis applies feature engineering, statistical measures, and technical indicators to extract actionable insights, which are then visualized using Python and Power BI.

The goal of this project is to understand:

How returns behave across sectors and market conditions

The relationship between risk (volatility) and returns

The impact of technical indicators like RSI and moving averages on performance
